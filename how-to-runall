runall.sh can be used to verify the program is creating the correct triangle list.

to use:
1) download the solution files provided by prof:
https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wgolab/graph1K_B.sort
https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wgolab/graph1K_C.sort
https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wgolab/graph10K_B.sort
https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wgolab/graph10K_C.sort
https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wgolab/graph100K_A.sort
https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wgolab/graph100K_B.sort
https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wgolab/graph100K_C.sort
https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wgolab/graph1M_B.sort

2) sort the files with the perl program sort.pl
 > perl sorted/sort.pl graph1K_B.sort > graph1K_B
etc.

3) save the resulting sorted files in sorted/ directory

4) download the sample inputs and save in inputs/ directory

5) from the directory you run the java program, run the script
 > ./runall.sh
